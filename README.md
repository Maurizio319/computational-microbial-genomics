# Computational microbial genomics
Notes of the course of computational microbial genomics professor Segata, QCB 2021-2022.

## Building
See this [Github gist](https://gist.github.com/giacThePhantom/e080a777782754542d0e081835669085) for a shell script that builds it for you or see the build/ subdirectory

## Lab materials
The "lab_materials" folder will be populated with useful materials (cheat sheets, installation guides...) since both slides and solutions for the lab are already provided. They are **NOT** included in the "principal.pdf" file.
